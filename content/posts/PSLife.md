# Conway's Game of Life in PowerShell
Link: [Github](https://github.com/dabeastnet/PSLife)


This project is a PowerShell script implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. The game simulates the life cycle of cells on a grid based on a set of rules. This implementation features a grid where cells evolve through generations, showcasing how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules.

## Features

- Randomized initial state for the grid.
- Customizable grid size.
- Continuous simulation until manually stopped.
- Display of the grid in the console, with live cells represented as blocks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core 6.0 and above.
- A terminal that supports Unicode characters for the best display experience.

### Installation

No installation is necessary. Just clone this repository or download the `.ps1` script to your local machine.

### Running the Simulation

1. Open your PowerShell terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `GameOfLife.ps1` script.
3. Execute the script by running:

```powershell
.\GameOfLife.ps1
```
